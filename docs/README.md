**Why are those directories missing?**
`spiffworkflow-backend`, `spiffworkflow-frontend`, and `spiff-arena-common` come from [AOT-Technologies/m8flow-core](https://github.com/AOT-Technologies/m8flow-core) (LGPL-2.1). They are not stored here to keep m8flow's Apache 2.0 license boundary clean. Run `./bin/fetch-upstream.sh` or `.\bin\fetch-upstream.ps1` once after cloning to populate them.

## Prerequisites (local dev, without Docker)

The list below assumes a **clean machine**. If a tool is already installed, skip its install step and continue. Verify with the version commands at the end of each row.

| Tool | Minimum version | Verify with | Why it's needed |
|------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Git** | any recent | `git --version` | Cloning the repo and fetching upstream |
| **Docker Desktop** / Docker Engine + Compose v2 | Compose v2 | `docker compose version` | Runs the infrastructure containers (Postgres, Keycloak, MinIO, Redis) |
| **Python** | 3.11+ | `python --version` | Backend runtime |
| **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** | latest | `uv --version` | Python env + dependency manager used by the backend launcher |
| **jq** | any | `jq --version` | Required by `bin/fetch-upstream.sh` to parse `upstream.sources.json` |
| **Node.js + npm** | Node 18+ (LTS) | `node --version`, `npm --version` | Frontend dev server (`m8flow-frontend`) |
| **curl** | any | `curl --version` | Health-check the backend `/v1.0/status` endpoint |

### Install commands per platform

> **These are either/or - run only the section for your OS.**

#### macOS (Homebrew)

```bash
brew install git jq uv node
# Docker Desktop: install from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
```

#### Ubuntu / Debian / WSL (Ubuntu)

A clean Ubuntu or WSL install is typically missing several of these. Install everything in one go:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y git jq curl build-essential python3 python3-venv python3-dev
# uv (single-line installer):
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# Node.js (NodeSource LTS):
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

> **Note:** `build-essential` and `python3-dev` are required so Python packages with native extensions can build from source on a clean Ubuntu/WSL install. Skipping them produces the *"Failed building wheel"* / *"missing package metadata"* errors documented in [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

#### Windows (PowerShell, via winget)

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e
winget install --id astral-sh.uv -e
winget install --id jqlang.jq -e
winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e
# Docker Desktop: install from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
```

> Restart your shell after installing so new tools are on `PATH`.

## Running Locally (without Docker for backend/frontend)

Use this mode for active development of m8flow extensions. Make sure you have completed the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-local-dev-without-docker) above.

### Step 1 - Fetch upstream SpiffWorkflow source (required)

> **Don't skip this step.** The upstream `spiffworkflow-backend`, `spiffworkflow-frontend`, and `spiff-arena-common` directories are **gitignored** and not present after a fresh clone. The backend will not start without them.

Run **only the command for your OS** - these are either/or, not sequential:

**Linux / macOS / WSL**

```bash
./bin/fetch-upstream.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
.\bin\fetch-upstream.ps1
```

This populates `spiffworkflow-backend/`, `spiffworkflow-frontend/`, and `spiff-arena-common/` at the upstream tag pinned in [`upstream.sources.json`](../upstream.sources.json).

### Step 2 - Start infrastructure services (Docker)

Start the infrastructure containers (database, Keycloak, MinIO, Redis), one-time init jobs (`minio-mc-init`, `keycloak-master-admin-init`), and the connector proxy - **but not** the `m8flow-backend` or `m8flow-frontend` containers, since those will run locally.

Run **only the command for your shell** - these are either/or, not sequential:

**Linux / macOS / WSL (bash, `\` continuation)**

```bash
docker compose --profile init -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml up -d --build \
  m8flow-db keycloak-db keycloak keycloak-proxy redis minio \
  minio-mc-init keycloak-master-admin-init \
  m8flow-connector-proxy
```

**Windows (PowerShell, backtick `` ` `` continuation)**

```powershell
docker compose --profile init -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml up -d --build `
  m8flow-db keycloak-db keycloak keycloak-proxy redis minio `
  minio-mc-init keycloak-master-admin-init `
  m8flow-connector-proxy
```

> **PowerShell users:** do not paste the bash version - `\` is not a line continuation in PowerShell and each wrapped line will be interpreted as a separate command. If unsure, run the single-line form instead:
>
> ```powershell
> docker compose --profile init -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml up -d --build m8flow-db keycloak-db keycloak keycloak-proxy redis minio minio-mc-init keycloak-master-admin-init m8flow-connector-proxy
> ```

What each service is for:

| Service | Role |
|---|---|
| `m8flow-db`, `keycloak-db` | PostgreSQL for m8flow app data and Keycloak |
| `keycloak`, `keycloak-proxy` | Identity provider |
| `redis`, `minio` | Celery broker and object storage |
| `minio-mc-init` *(init)* | Creates required MinIO buckets |
| `keycloak-master-admin-init` *(init)* | **Required for "Global admin sign in".** Creates the `m8flow-backend` client and `super-admin` user in the **master** realm. Without it, the master-realm login flow fails with *"Client not found"*. |
| `m8flow-connector-proxy` | Backend dispatches connector commands here (SMTP, Slack, HTTP). Without it, the backend logs `WinError 10061` on port 6844. |

> If you previously ran the full Docker stack, **stop the `m8flow-backend` and `m8flow-frontend` containers** before continuing - otherwise the local dev servers will collide on ports 6840/6841.

### Step 3 - Start the backend

Run **only the command for your OS** - these are either/or:

**Linux / macOS / WSL**

```bash
./m8flow-backend/bin/run_m8flow_backend.sh 6840 --reload
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
.\m8flow-backend\bin\run_m8flow_backend.ps1 6840
```

When `uv` is available locally, the backend launcher syncs backend dependencies automatically before starting and runs the backend through `uv`. Set `M8FLOW_BACKEND_SYNC_DEPS=false` to skip sync, or `M8FLOW_BACKEND_USE_UV=false` to use the current Python environment directly.

Verify the backend is up:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6840/v1.0/status
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "ok": true, "can_access_frontend": true }
```

### Step 4 - Start the frontend

> **If `npm install` has already been run for this checkout, skip directly to `npm start`.** The `node_modules/` directory under `m8flow-frontend/` is the signal - if it exists and is recent, you can resume from `npm start`.

```bash
cd m8flow-frontend
npm install   # skip if node_modules/ is already populated for this checkout
npm start
```

Docker bind-mounts the repo `process_models/` directory into the backend and Celery containers, so a locally started backend and a containerized worker read the same process-model files by default.

If the frontend fails with a missing Rollup native package such as `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc`, reinstall `m8flow-frontend` dependencies on that machine with `npm install`.

### Step 5 - Run a Celery worker

**Linux / macOS / WSL**

```bash
./m8flow-backend/bin/run_m8flow_celery_worker.sh
```

**Windows (no POSIX shell available)**

Run the Celery worker via Docker instead. Since the Celery worker shares code with `m8flow-backend`, make sure the `m8flow-backend` container is **stopped** (you are running the backend locally) before building the worker container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml up -d --build m8flow-backend m8flow-celery-worker
```

## Access the Application with Multitenant mode OFF

Although m8flow is designed as a fully multitenant system, you can configure it to present as a single-tenant UI by setting the environment variable `MULTI_TENANT_ON=false`.

With this setting, open `http://localhost:6841/` in your browser. You will be redirected directly to the Keycloak login page.

| `editor` | Create and edit process models |
| `viewer` | Read-only access |
| `integrator` | Service task / connector access |
| `reviewer` | Review and approve tasks |
| `submitter` | Submit work |

## Sample Templates

m8flow includes sample workflow templates that can help teams get started quickly with common approval, notification, escalation, and integration scenarios.

The sample templates package includes pre-built workflows and guidance for:

- automatically loading templates during startup
- using integration-focused templates such as Salesforce, Slack, SMTP, and PostgreSQL examples

For the full template catalog and setup instructions, refer to [`m8flow-backend/sample_templates/README.md`](../m8flow-backend/sample_templates/README.md).

## Integration Services

m8flow includes supporting services for connector execution and event-driven workflow processing. These components can be run alongside the core platform depending on your deployment needs.

For service-specific setup, configuration, and usage details, refer to:

- [`m8flow-connector-proxy/README.md`](../m8flow-connector-proxy/README.md) for connector proxy support such as SMTP, Slack, HTTP, and related integrations
- [`m8flow-nats-consumer/README.md`](../m8flow-nats-consumer/README.md) for NATS-based event consumption and event-driven workflow execution

## Troubleshooting

Common issues encountered when running m8flow locally and how to resolve them.

### `jq: command not found` when running `bin/fetch-upstream.sh`

`fetch-upstream.sh` uses `jq` to parse [`upstream.sources.json`](../upstream.sources.json). Install it:

- **macOS:** `brew install jq`
- **Ubuntu / WSL:** `sudo apt-get install -y jq`
- **Windows:** `winget install --id jqlang.jq -e`

### Backend startup fails with "Failed building wheel" or "missing package metadata"

This typically happens on a **clean Ubuntu/WSL environment** where Python build tooling and headers are missing. Install the build prerequisites and retry:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev python3-venv
```

Then re-run the backend launcher. If the error persists, clear the local virtualenv and let `uv` rebuild it:

```bash
rm -rf spiffworkflow-backend/.venv
./m8flow-backend/bin/run_m8flow_backend.sh 6840 --reload
```

### Backend startup fails on tenant migration with `UPDATE "refresh_token" SET m8f_tenant_id = ...`

This error appears when an older Keycloak/database state coexists with a newer tenant migration. The migration tries to renumber `m8f_tenant_id` on a `refresh_token` row whose `old_tenant_id` no longer exists in the new schema.

Workarounds, in order of preference:

1. **Fresh local data** (development only - destroys local state):

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml down -v
   docker compose --profile init -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml up -d --build m8flow-db keycloak-db keycloak keycloak-proxy redis minio minio-mc-init
   ```

   Then restart the backend so migrations run against an empty database.

2. **Skip M8Flow migrations on next start** (temporary, for diagnostics only):

   ```bash
   M8FLOW_BACKEND_UPGRADE_DB=false ./m8flow-backend/bin/run_m8flow_backend.sh 6840 --reload
   ```

3. **Inspect the offending row** before re-running migrations:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml exec m8flow-db \
     psql -U spiffworkflow_backend spiffworkflow_backend_local_development \
     -c 'SELECT id, m8f_tenant_id FROM refresh_token;'
   ```

   Reach out on the project tracker with the row contents if you need a non-destructive fix.

### Frontend fails with missing `@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc` (or another Rollup native package)

npm's optional-dependency resolution sometimes skips the platform-specific Rollup binary. Reinstall from a clean `node_modules`:

```bash
cd m8flow-frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

### Port already in use (6840 / 6841 / 6842 / 6843 / 6849)

A leftover Docker container or another local process is bound to one of m8flow's ports. Check the [Default host ports](../README.md#default-host-ports) table in the main README to identify the service, then either stop the conflicting container (`docker compose -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml stop m8flow-backend`) or change the port in `.env` (see [Port conflicts](../README.md#3-port-conflicts-read-this-first)).

### `spiffworkflow-backend` directory not found

You skipped [Step 1 - Fetch upstream SpiffWorkflow source](#step-1---fetch-upstream-spiffworkflow-source-required). Run `./bin/fetch-upstream.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `.\bin\fetch-upstream.ps1` (Windows) and retry.

### "Global admin sign in" fails with *"Client not found"* on `realms/master`

The master realm has no `m8flow-backend` client because the `keycloak-master-admin-init` service was never run. This service is **init-profile** and provisions both the master-realm client and the `super-admin` user.

```bash
docker compose --profile init -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml up -d keycloak-master-admin-init
```

It exits when done (`restart: "no"`). Verify it succeeded:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml logs keycloak-master-admin-init
```

Then retry "Global admin sign in" in a **fresh private window** (your previous tab is holding a stale auth code from the failed attempt).

### Backend logs `WinError 10061` / `Connection refused` to `localhost:6844`

`m8flow-connector-proxy` is not running. The backend uses it to dispatch connector service-task commands (SMTP, Slack, HTTP). Start it:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/m8flow-docker-compose.yml up -d --build m8flow-connector-proxy
```

If you don't need connector tasks for what you're testing, you can ignore the warning - it's not fatal to startup.
