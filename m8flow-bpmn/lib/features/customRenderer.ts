/**
 * Restyles diagram node rendering to match `Process Modeler.dc.html`
 * (node-shape-styling ticket, Process Modeler visual fidelity map):
 * gunmetal-equivalent start events, success-colored end events, and
 * info-colored task-type icons on a light-gray-bordered box (rather than
 * bpmn-js's own black-on-black defaults).
 *
 * Composition, not reimplementation: this wraps bpmn-js's own
 * `bpmnRenderer` singleton (injected, not subclassed/`super`-called) —
 * calling its real `drawShape` to draw the element exactly as stock
 * bpmn-js would (box, embedded label, multi-instance/loop/compensation
 * markers, the lot), then recolors specific already-drawn children.
 * Reimplementing `renderTask`/`renderEvent` from scratch was considered
 * and rejected: those functions also own marker rendering (loop,
 * multi-instance, compensation, ad-hoc) that this seed diagram doesn't
 * happen to exercise but real diagrams do — reproducing them by hand
 * would risk silently dropping that rendering for the sake of a color
 * change. Registered as a higher-priority `bpmnRenderer`-adjacent
 * renderer via `additionalModules`, the same "override/augment the
 * DI-registered internals" pattern `customPalette.ts` and
 * `positionContextPadAboveTarget` (BpmnCanvas.tsx) already use.
 *
 * Scope: start events, end events, user/service/script/manual/business-
 * rule/send/receive tasks, generic tasks, call activities (the original
 * "biggest miss" ticket plus the task-subtype-styling follow-on),
 * all five gateway types (exclusive — the "decision node" the user
 * flagged as still untouched when the map was — wrongly — closed as
 * complete — plus parallel/inclusive/event-based/complex), sequence flow
 * arrows, pool/lane borders, Sub-Process/Ad-Hoc Sub-Process/Transaction
 * containers, every event-definition icon (message/timer/signal/error/
 * escalation/compensate/conditional/link/terminate) across Start/End/
 * Intermediate/Boundary events, and data/artifacts (Data Object/Store
 * References, Text Annotations, Groups, Associations, Message Flows) —
 * the full BPMN element-type inventory a real diagram renders is now
 * covered; see the map's own Decisions-so-far for how each category was
 * treated.
 *
 * Operation-group color palette (color-theory pass, live user feedback:
 * "we are using just 4 colours... the combination of blue and green on
 * some of the icons is genuinely ugly"). Reviewed against
 * https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/ (don't rely on
 * color alone to convey meaning — every group below is also a distinct
 * hand-drawn glyph shape, color is reinforcement, not the sole signal) and
 * basic color-wheel theory (spread hues around the wheel rather than
 * clustering near-adjacent ones, since two saturated near-adjacent hues —
 * exactly what blue ring-icon-on-blue-icon or blue-next-to-green was doing
 * — read as muddy/clashing at small icon sizes). Icons/markers are now
 * sorted into operation groups, each carrying its own hue *and* used
 * nowhere else, so no two groups fight for attention in the same glyph:
 *
 * - Structural (unchanged `TASK_STROKE`, neutral gray `--color-border`):
 *   containers and data holders that aren't "operations" at all — generic
 *   Task, Sub-Process, Ad-Hoc Sub-Process, Transaction, Pool, Lane, Group,
 *   Data Object/Store References. Deliberately left uncolored — WCAG's own
 *   "don't rely on color alone" cuts both ways: reserving color for
 *   elements that actually need distinguishing keeps it meaningful.
 * - Flow control (`FLOW_CONTROL_COLOR`, violet, new `--color-flow-control`
 *   token): all five gateway markers, the Ad-Hoc "~" marker, and the
 *   Terminate/Compensate/Conditional/Link event icons — all "control how
 *   the flow branches, loops, or ends" in kind.
 * - Timing (`TIMER_COLOR`, amber, `--color-warning`): the Timer icon only
 *   — the one operation group with a single, near-universal color
 *   convention (clocks are amber), so it gets a dedicated group of one.
 * - System (`SYSTEM_COLOR`, blue, `--color-info` — the file's original,
 *   now-narrowed `TASK_ICON_COLOR`): every task/activity icon (User,
 *   Service, Script, Manual, Business-Rule, Send, Receive Task, the Call
 *   Activity "+" marker) plus the Message/Signal/Escalation event icons
 *   and the Message Flow connector. **A later live-feedback pass merged
 *   what was originally two groups here** — User/Manual Task first got
 *   their own separate pink "human work" color, but live review showed
 *   that reads as an unintentional inconsistency, not a meaningful
 *   distinction: every *other* task icon shares one color, so having
 *   exactly one (Manual Task) in a different color looked like a mistake,
 *   not a category. All task/activity icons are now uniformly blue.
 * - Error handling (`ERROR_COLOR`, red, `--color-destructive`): the Error
 *   event icon only — the one place reusing the app's "destructive"
 *   semantic is a genuine conceptual match, not just a reused hex.
 *
 * **Unified event styling** (live user feedback: "events dont have a
 * common style. Schedule is different to the rest of the events. Schedule
 * looks better"): every typed event, of any kind (Start/End/Intermediate/
 * Boundary) and any event-definition type, now draws through
 * `buildUnifiedEventIconSpecs` (`shapeTreatment.ts`) — a single ring,
 * filled `--color-card`, stroked in its own operation-group color, exactly
 * matching the look Timer
 * ("Schedule") already had. Previously only Timer collapsed to one
 * colored ring; every other typed event kept bpmn-js's own stock ring(s)
 * (single for Start/End, double for Intermediate/Boundary) recolored
 * *neutral*, with only the small icon glyph carrying color — two
 * genuinely different constructions for what should read as one family.
 * Since ring and icon now always share the same hue, there's no remaining
 * ring-vs-icon mismatch left to clash in the first place (a stronger fix
 * than the prior pass's "make the end-event ring neutral for typed
 * events" workaround, which this supersedes). Untyped ("none") events are
 * unaffected — Start/Boundary/Intermediate keep a plain neutral ring
 * (`START_EVENT_STROKE`/`BOUNDARY_EVENT_STROKE`, now the same muted gray
 * as a sequence flow — see below), and an untyped End event keeps its
 * green ring, matching the mockup's own plain-end-event illustration.
 * Distinguishability between start/end doesn't depend on ring color in
 * the first place — bpmn-js already gives end events a 4px stroke vs.
 * start's ~2px (confirmed reading `BpmnRenderer.js`).
 *
 * **"Solid black" lines fixed** (live user feedback): `START_EVENT_STROKE`
 * and `BOUNDARY_EVENT_STROKE` used `--color-foreground` (near-black,
 * #1F2937 — the mockup's own "gunmetal" spec for a start event), which
 * read as inconsistent stray black lines next to the muted-gray sequence
 * flows and light-gray task borders everywhere else. Both now reuse
 * `SEQUENCE_FLOW_STROKE` directly.
 *
 * **Subtle task shadow** (live user feedback: "add a subtle shadow to
 * tasks"): every task/activity/container box (`applyTaskShadow`) gets a
 * soft `drop-shadow` on its outer rect — a restrained elevation cue, not a
 * heavy border, in the same spirit as this app's existing shadcn/ui card
 * shadows elsewhere.
 *
 * Also introduces this file's first **dashed** connection: a sequence
 * flow whose source is a `BoundaryEvent` (an exception/interrupt path) now
 * draws with a dash pattern, a non-color-based signal distinguishing it
 * from the diagram's normal "happy path" flow — the live user request
 * that prompted this pass explicitly invited trying dashed lines, and
 * boundary-event-sourced flows are a real, meaningful place to use one
 * (every other dashed line already in this file — Association, Group,
 * Message Flow — is a stock bpmn-js default, not a customization).
 *
 * **What lives where**: the color palette, tail-slice/icon lookup tables,
 * and every icon's geometry (path-string math, ring radii) are pure
 * functions of element type/size and live in `shapeTreatment.ts` instead
 * of here — they're the parts with a documented history of hard-won,
 * live-debugged bugs (style-vs-attribute reads, off-by-one tail slices,
 * label-color coupling), and pure functions are the ones jsdom's lack of
 * SVG support doesn't block from being unit-tested (see
 * `test/shapeTreatment.test.ts`). This file stays the DOM-effecting half:
 * given bpmn-js's already-drawn children and a `ShapeSpec` describing what
 * to draw next, it's the only place that actually queries/mutates/creates
 * real SVG nodes.
