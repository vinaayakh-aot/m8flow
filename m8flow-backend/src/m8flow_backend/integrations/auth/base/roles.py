"""Canonical neutral role vocabulary for m8flow RBAC.

This is m8flow's own, provider-independent vocabulary. A provider translates
between these names and its realization of them (Keycloak: organization groups
named ``Administrators``/``Designers``/... plus realm roles).

The Keycloak group-name table lives in ``integrations.auth.keycloak.role_mapping``.
``services.tenant_group_mapping`` re-exports these names for older callers.
