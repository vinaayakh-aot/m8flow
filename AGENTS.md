## Project Context

This repository is `m8flow`. The HTTP host lives in `m8flow-backend` and consumes
`m8flow-bpmn-core` as a pinned wheel (`0.1.0` @ `a3d4fd190a384ad06af84f122cad3d8818250c45`).
Do not vendor core source. Do not import `spiffworkflow` from `m8flow-backend`.
Do not reintroduce `spiffworkflow-backend/`, `spiffworkflow-frontend/`, or
`spiff-arena-common/`. Recovery pin: `docs/upstream-recovery.md`.

## Hard Rules

- Do not import `spiffworkflow` or `spiffworkflow_backend` from `m8flow-backend`.
- Routes must not call `execute_command` / `execute_query` / `run_due_scheduler_jobs`.
- Routes must not INSERT into `user` / `group` / `permission_*` / `tenant`.
- Prefer the eight host modules: `workflow`, `catalog`, `human_task`, `scheduler`,
  `identity`, `auth`, `authorization`, `secrets`.

## Repository Ownership

Only modify files that belong to the `m8flow` repository.

Typical safe areas include:

- `m8flow-backend/`
- `m8flow-frontend/`
- M8Flow configuration
- tests owned by this repo
- documentation owned by this repo

When unsure whether a file is owned by this repo, stop and explain the uncertainty before changing it.

## Architecture Guidance

M8Flow is a host on `m8flow-bpmn-core`, not a SpiffArena fork.

- Keep workflow writes behind `m8flow_backend.workflow`.
- Preserve tenant isolation and RBAC (`allow_uri` + dispatcher `authorize`).
- Cookie for active tenant is `m8flow_selected_tenant`.

### Practical Rules To Avoid Copy-Gate Failures

- Default to composition over copying:
  - Frontend: wrap upstream components/pages via `@spiff-core` or the override
    resolver and keep only the M8Flow-specific delta in the repo-owned file.
  - Backend: patch or wrap the upstream service/controller behavior instead of
    restating the upstream function body in a repo-owned file.
- Do not copy upstream prop/type boilerplate just to preserve compatibility.
  Prefer deriving contracts from the wrapped upstream export when possible
  (for example `ComponentProps<typeof UpstreamComponent>` in frontend wrappers).
- If an override needs extra UI data such as tenant labels, move that logic into
  small repo-owned helpers/hooks/components rather than cloning the full upstream
  page or table.
- For shell entrypoints and startup scripts, do not keep the same step order,
  helper names, comments, and final command layout as the upstream script.
  Re-express the script in an M8Flow-native structure even when the runtime
  behavior is similar.
- Do not assume that renaming identifiers, reformatting, or deleting a few lines
  is enough. The CPD gate is token-based and the raw-line gate also checks
  contiguous copied blocks and containment.
- Before finalizing any change that touches a repo-owned wrapper/override or a
  script resembling an upstream script, run the local copy checks when feasible:
  - `python bin/check-upstream-copying.py --diff origin/main`
  - `python bin/check-upstream-cpd.py`
- Treat baseline updates as a last resort, not a routine fix. First try to
  shrink the override/script until the new finding disappears.

## Keycloak Login UX

- Do not change the Keycloak login experience to a two-step username-then-password flow.
- For both the `m8flow` realm and the `master` realm, the login page must collect username and password on the same page.
- If you touch Keycloak themes, browser flows, realm imports, or bootstrap scripts, preserve single-page login by keeping `Username Password Form` active and preventing username-only / identity-first login steps from becoming the user-facing path unless explicitly requested.
- Do not rely on the upstream/base Keycloak `login-username` page for normal sign-in. Repo-owned theme logic must keep the effective sign-in UX on one page.
- After Keycloak login/theme/flow changes, verify both realm login pages still render combined username and password fields before considering the work complete.

## Multi-Tenancy and RBAC

Be careful with tenant and permission-related behavior.

- Preserve tenant isolation.
- Do not bypass tenant scoping.
- Do not remove or weaken RBAC checks.
- Ensure tenant IDs such as `m8f_tenant_id` are handled explicitly where required.
- Be cautious around login, group assignment, permissions, human task assignment, and database queries.
- Do not validate shared-realm auth or RBAC changes only with `admin` or `super-admin`.
- After changes to login, token handling, tenant selection, organization membership sync, or permission patches, verify at least one non-admin shared-realm user such as `editor` or `reviewer`.
- The minimum protected-route regression check for a non-admin shared-realm user is:
  - `GET /v1.0/onboarding`
  - `GET /v1.0/tasks`
- When touching request-time token or membership refresh code, add or update a route-level test for a stale local shared-realm user and a thin token that must be enriched back into the correct tenant-scoped groups.
- Shared-realm regressions must include the multi-organization case, not just the single-organization case. A user such as `editor` joining a second Keycloak organization must still be able to access `GET /v1.0/onboarding` and `GET /v1.0/tasks` after tenant selection/finalization.
- Do not treat a token as authoritative for shared-realm RBAC refresh merely because it lists organization memberships. For multi-organization users, the active organization’s local groups must be present, or the token must be enriched from Keycloak before tenant-scoped group sync runs.
- In shared-realm multitenant flows, do not treat frontend `localStorage` tenant values as authoritative tenant finalization. The backend relies on the `m8flow_selected_tenant` cookie for active-tenant resolution, so UI gates must not bypass tenant selection just because a stale tenant alias remains in browser storage.

## Database and Migrations

- Do not make destructive schema changes without clearly explaining the risk.
- Alembic migrations must be reversible where practical.
- Preserve existing data unless the task explicitly requires a data migration.
- Consider PostgreSQL as the primary supported database unless stated otherwise.

## Testing and Verification

When changing backend code, consider running or updating relevant tests.

When changing frontend code, consider lint/build impact.

After applying code changes, run the relevant repo-owned checks for the area you touched whenever feasible:

- Backend changes:
  - Run the Python lint target for repo-owned backend code (`ruff` in `m8flow-backend`) when backend Python files change.
  - Run the most relevant `pytest` target for the touched backend files.
  - Prefer focused tests first, then widen only if the change is broad or cross-cutting.
- Frontend changes:
  - Run `npm run lint` in `m8flow-frontend`.
  - Run `npm test` in `m8flow-frontend`.
  - Run `npm run build` in `m8flow-frontend` when UI, routing, bundling, or shared frontend infrastructure changed.
- CI or workflow changes:
  - Sanity-check the modified workflow file and, when practical, run the same local commands the workflow is intended to execute.
- Docker, Keycloak, or startup-script changes:
  - Run the relevant shell syntax checks and/or `docker compose ... config` validation when applicable.
- E2E/browser tests:
  - These are not part of the default required verification for now.
  - Only run them when the user explicitly asks, when the task specifically targets browser automation, or when unit/build checks are insufficient for the risk.

Before finalizing work, summarize:

- What changed
- Which files were changed
- What was intentionally not changed
- Any tests or checks run
- Any remaining risks or assumptions

## Dependency Rules

- Do not add new dependencies unless necessary.
- Explain why a new dependency is needed.
- Prefer existing project patterns and libraries.

## Git Hygiene

- Keep changes focused.
- Avoid unrelated formatting changes.
- Do not include generated files unless required.
- Do not reintroduce SpiffArena vendor trees (`spiffworkflow-backend/`, `spiffworkflow-frontend/`, `spiff-arena-common/`).
